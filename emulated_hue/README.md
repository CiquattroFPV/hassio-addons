# Hue Emulation for Home Assistant

Convert your Home Assistant instance to a fully functional Philips HUE bridge!
Control all lights connected to your Home Assistant box with HUE compatible apps/devices like the official Hue app, Hue essentials and Philips Ambilight+Hue etc. Including (experimental) support for Entertainment function!

## How to connect to the virtual bridge ?
- Once the add-on is started, it will be available as a HUE bridge on your network.
- From your app/device (for example the official HUE app) search for HUE bridges.
- Once the bridge is found by your app/device, there's a notification sent to Home Assistant if you want to enable pairing mode (same as pressing the physical button on the real bridge). It will show you a message in the notification area WITHIN Home Assistant.
- Once you enabled pairing mode, your app has 30 seconds to connect.

## Important note
This virtual bridge runs at HTTP port 80 and HTTPS port 443 on your local network. These ports can not be changed as the HUE infrastructure requires them to be at these defaults.
